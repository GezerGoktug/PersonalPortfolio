# PersonalPortfolio
**<p>In this project, I created a personal portfolio site with html css. In the project, a navbar that remains fixed at the top was designed with css flex position:fixed. In addition, the links in the navbar direct us to the relevant section. In my projects section, some of my html css related sites were created in a sequential structure with css flex. Also It was created in a mobile compatible design for the site.</p>**
